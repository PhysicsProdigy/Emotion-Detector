# Emotion-Detector
Winton's AI project Emotion detector Python

This was also another University Project where I constructed an CNN to determine wether users were displaying either 5 emotions through their camera feed. 

Things that i had to do:
  - Pre process the images 
  - Use these processed images to pass them through a CNN where it would train its models and generate a .weights file.
  - This weights file is then used to determine if a new image is one of the emotions.
