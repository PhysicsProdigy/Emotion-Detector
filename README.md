# Emotion-Detector
Winton's AI project Emotion detector Python

This was also another University Project where I constructed an CNN to determine wether users were displaying either 5 emotions through their camera feed. 

Things that i had to do:
  - Pre process the images 
  - Use these processed images to pass them through a CNN where it would train its models and generate a .weights file.
  - This weights file is then used to determine if a new image is one of the emotions. 

ResNet Update - 03/11/2023 
I've implemented a new model with references from the CNN4 that i've previously built. 
 - ResNeyPython files attached, weights and json files are too big to attach
 - Changes to the original CNN and model / main files were to work with both networks.
 - Split dataset should be placed in the original FER2013 dataset outside of the emotion folders
 - Validation.ipynb file used to provide metrics for the images in validation.
